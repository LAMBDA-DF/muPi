You can use any combination of the variables that are defined below. To combine them
for the selection cuts you should use " && ". You can also use transformations of the
variables such as pow(x,y), sqrt(x), etc.

EG for cuts: flag==0 && E0>1 && E0<5
EG for histogram, mean energy per pixel: E0/n0
EG for histogram, track length: sqrt( pow(xMax-xMin, 2) + pow(yMax-yMin, 2) )

List of available variables:
  nSat:  number of saturated pixels      
  flag:  error code      
  xMin:  x coordinate of the leftmost pixel   
  xMax:  x coordinate of the rightmost pixel   
  yMin:  y coordinate of the bottommost pixel   
  yMax:  y coordinate of the topmost pixel   

  E0:    total energy of the "level 0" pixels      
  n0:    number of "level 0" pixels           
  xBary0: x coordinate of the signal weighted barycenter using "level 0" pixels       
  yBary0: y coordinate of the signal weighted barycenter using "level 0" pixels 
  xVar0:  signal weighted variance along the x direction using "level 0" pixels
  yVar0:  signal weighted variance along the y direction using "level 0" pixels  
  E1, n1, xBary1, yBary1, xVar1, yVar1: same as avobe but including "level 1" pixels
  E2, n2, xBary2, yBary2, xVar2, yVar2: same as avobe but including "level 2" pixels
  E3, n3, xBary3, yBary3, xVar3, yVar3: same as avobe but including "level 3" pixels
